       representing the card details being inputted - taking the form of a
        credit card. The rest of the design would be kept professional
         with the angular design and blue base colour.`,

      whether it be a product, service or anything else. Once I decided on my

    desc: `We're all used to seeing standard 'tenkey' layout calculator designs and apps,
       most of which include a scientific calculator feature which is just an
       afterthought. My goal with this brief was to include the core functionality
       of a scientific calculator, packaged in a modern and clean design aesthetic.`,

    desc: `Logo design is definitely not as familiar to me as UI and web design.
      This was an attempt to create a logo for one of my side projects - a expense tracker app.
      The logo is based on a pando tree, as well as an arrow.`,

    desc: `I decided to recreate the Github user profile page, with a focus on
      improving the layout rather than recreating the core UI elements. My changes
      were ultimately geared towards creating a more organised profile page where each section
      is distinctly separate from the rest.`,

    desc: `It took some time before I decided which kind of settings I wanted to design, there was simply
    too much to choose from! I ended up going for a background/ wallpaper customiser that my phone's home launcher uses.
    I quite like how it turned out - inspired by a minimal, sleek aesthetic.`,
