    desc: `With this brief, I immediately wanted to include a visual element
       representing the card details being inputted - taking the form of a
        credit card. The rest of the design would be kept professional
         with the angular design and blue base colour.`,

    desc: `Initially I struggled thinking of what to create a landing page of,
      whether it be a product, service or anything else. Once I decided on my
       topic I wanted to keep it simple and draw attention to the product being sold.`,

    desc: `We're all used to seeing standard 'tenkey' layout calculator designs and apps,
       most of which include a scientific calculator feature which is just an
       afterthought. My goal with this brief was to include the core functionality
       of a scientific calculator, packaged in a modern and clean design aesthetic.`,

    desc: `Logo design is definitely not as familiar to me as UI and web design.
      This was an attempt to create a logo for one of my side projects - a expense tracker app.
      The logo is based on a pando tree, as well as an arrow.`,

    desc: `I decided to recreate the Github user profile page, with a focus on
      improving the layout rather than recreating the core UI elements. My changes
      were ultimately geared towards creating a more organised profile page where each section
      is distinctly separate from the rest.`,

    desc: `It took some time before I decided which kind of settings I wanted to design, there was simply
    too much to choose from! I ended up going for a background/ wallpaper customiser that my phone's home launcher uses.
    I quite like how it turned out - inspired by a minimal, sleek aesthetic.`,

    desc: `I recently created a 404 page at work but unfortunately could not
    include any illustrations because it did not fit my companies brand style.
    Hence this was a great chance for me to try and use illustrations as part of
    my design.`,

    desc: `I had an urge to play around with some 2.5d buttons, achieved by adding a small chin/ thickness to each button,.
    I think it does a good job at creating a feeling of depth without overdoing it with complicated shadows.
    The design should lean towards a retro vibe, portraying the clicky push buttons of previous decades. `,

    desc: `A simple and straightforward approach to the social share button.
    Ideally the tooltips would be used on a larger, desktop based device 
    while the popup would be used on a smaller, mobile device.
    While designing the tooltips, I found a useful way of creating the tip by rotating 
    a square and hiding protruding corners using border radius.`,
