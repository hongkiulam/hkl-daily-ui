    desc: `With this brief, I immediately wanted to include a visual element
       representing the card details being inputted - taking the form of a
        credit card. The rest of the design would be kept professional
         with the angular design and blue base colour.`,

    desc: `Initially I struggled thinking of what to create a landing page of,
      whether it be a product, service or anything else. Once I decided on my
       topic I wanted to keep it simple and draw attention to the product being sold.`,

    desc: `We're all used to seeing standard 'tenkey' layout calculator designs and apps,
       most of which include a scientific calculator feature which is just an
       afterthought. My goal with this brief was to include the core functionality
       of a scientific calculator, packaged in a modern and clean design aesthetic.`,

    desc: `Logo design is definitely not as familiar to me as UI and web design.
      This was an attempt to create a logo for one of my side projects - a expense tracker app.
      The logo is based on a pando tree, as well as an arrow.`,

    desc: `I decided to recreate the Github user profile page, with a focus on
      improving the layout rather than recreating the core UI elements. My changes
      were ultimately geared towards creating a more organised profile page where each section
      is distinctly separate from the rest.`,

    desc: `It took some time before I decided which kind of settings I wanted to design, there was simply
    too much to choose from! I ended up going for a background/ wallpaper customiser that my phone's home launcher uses.
    I quite like how it turned out - inspired by a minimal, sleek aesthetic.`,

    desc: `I recently created a 404 page at work but unfortunately could not
    include any illustrations because it did not fit my companies brand style.
    Hence this was a great chance for me to try and use illustrations as part of
    my design.`,

    desc: `I had an urge to play around with some 2.5d buttons, achieved by adding a small chin/ thickness to each button.
    I think it does a good job at creating a feeling of depth without overdoing it with complicated shadows.
    The design should lean towards a retro vibe, portraying the clicky push buttons of previous decades. `,

    title: "Social Share",

    desc: `A simple and straightforward approach to the social share button.
    Ideally the tooltips would be used on a larger, desktop based device 
    while the popup would be used on a smaller, mobile device.
    While designing the tooltips, I found a useful way of creating the tip by rotating 
    a square and hiding protruding corners using border radius.`,

    Inspired by other people's approaches to this challenge online, whom had also
    based their designs on animals/ characters.`,

    desc: `As I’m back to full working days my available time for this challenge going forward will be limited.
    I wanted to go for a classic and familiar design, that draws more focus towards the product information, since
    this is what I feel more people are concerned about as opposed to the product images.`,

    desc: `A lot of the time while I think of the design/ layout, I will search for inspiration online almost instinctively. This has lead to me feeling as though I lack the creativity for creating layouts individually so for this challenge I wanted to come up with a layout by myself.
    A result of that may be that it is less daring and unique, but I think I did a pretty good job.`,

    desc: `I had the random idea during the day to do a Blackpink inpsired programming project some time in the future,
    but I feel this brief lent itself quite nicely to that idea, so two birds one stone I guess!
    A highlight of this design is that I got to play around with extrapolating the gradient background of the original image,
    to fill the desired frame. I did this through a combination of flipping the original image, masks, and applying a overlaying gradient.   `,

    title: "On Off Switch",

    desc: `I was very happy to finally get a relatively simple brief because I meant I could realistically get something decent
    done in the hour or two that I have after work.
    I considered doing a basic toggle switch, focussing on proportions, shadows and the more minute details of the design,
    however it wasn’t too much more effort to add some flair to the design by giving it some context.
    The context chosen is something we are forced to be familiar with nowadays, which is volume toggles
     - for both muting yourself and others in the video conferences!`,
